A *cloud* is a network of remote servers that deliver computing services
(like storage, servers, databases, networking, and software)
on-demand via the internet â€” typically on a pay-as-you-go model.

- *On-Demand Self-Service* - Users can provision resources automatically without human interaction.
- *Broad Network Access* - Services are accessible over the internet via standard protocols.
- *Resource Pooling* - Physical and virtual resources are pooled and dynamically assigned to users as needed.
- *Rapid Elasticity* - Resources can scale up/down quickly to match workload demand.
- *Measured Service* - Usage is monitored, controlled, and billed (pay-per-use or subscription).
